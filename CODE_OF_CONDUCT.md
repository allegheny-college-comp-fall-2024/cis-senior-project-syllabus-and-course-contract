## CIS Department Senior Project Contract

The Senior Project ("Comp") represents an original work developed by a student or approved team
of students in close consultation by at least two (2) readers. These readers occupy both advisory
and evaluative roles for a Comp. This contract outlines the minimum expected student and faculty
contributions to the project including (but may not be limited to) time commitments, communication
standards, and expected outcomes.

This contract governs _all_ semesters of the Comp process. It does not, however, contain grading
specifications or evaluative criteria. This contract governs student and reader responsibilities
and commitment to process.

### Changes to this contract

This contract is not complete at time of issue. It is incumbent on the student(s) and reader(s) involved
to finalize details included below. While this document proposes several minimum standards generally
accepted as best practices in the Allegheny College CIS Department, students completing a `DOUBL` Comp,
for example, should revise this contract to include expectations implied or made explicit by other
departments under which Comp work is completed. In nearly every case, student or reader ammendments or
revisions are suggested and welcome.

Parties involved in this contract may propose changes to this document by `13 September 2022` or,
in the event of an approved extenuating circumstance, within 2 weeks of such a circumstance. Approval
of what constitutes an "extenuating circumstance" is left to the project reader(s) once notified.

### Contract provisions

#### Meetings

Students and readers agree to meet on a weekly basis for a minumum of thirty (30) minutes outside of any
dedicated Comp coursework (i.e. `600`-level classes). At least as concerns project first readers, these meetings
must be _regular_ and _scheduled_.

These meetings are a necessary part of completing project process tasks. Students are expected to bring work 
which indicates acceptable progress on tasks assigned as either part of `600`-level coursework or independently 
assigned by project reader(s).

Expected tasks may include (but are not limited to):

* drafts of thesis document writing
* writing outlines or project diagrams (e.g. flowcharts, et al.)
* research articles or data sets for discussions, analysis, or evaluation
* summaries of code `commit`s or other computational artifacts
* creation or discussion of on-going `Pull Requests` or `Issues`

Readers agree to provide timely (i.e. within one week or by next meeting) feedback on work and assign
additional generative, exploratory, or revision on the same timely basis.

#### Class sessions

Students and readers agree to attend the appropriate weekly Comp CIS `600`-level sessions on a weekly
basis (held on Fridays) unless prevented by sickness, College-approved absence, or other approved
reasons for inability to attend. Regardless of reason, students and readers are expected to inform
each other of any absences and arrange for additional support to either keep up with or achieve
class session goals (i.e. activities). An absence from a class period in which an activity or deliverable
is assigned does not grant an exception from completing the assigned work in a timely manner (i.e. by
any indicated due date).

##### Registering for the appropriate `600`-level CIS deparmtent courses

Students agree to register for the appropriate `600`-level CIS department course according to the major
under which they are completing their Comp project. This must be completed by `10 September`. This date
is a College deadline; failure to register for the correct course and section will require students to
submit a petition to the Dean's Exemption Committee (DEC) which has, historically, not always approved
requests for students who failed to register for the correct Comp-level course work in a timely manner.

#### Institutional Review Board proposals

Students completing projects containing experiments for which an Institutuional Review Board (IRB) approval
is required are expected to seek out and complete necessary proposal materials by `November 1`. Failure to
do so may impact a student's ability to obtain the necessary approval to run experiments, thereby significantly
impacting a student's ability to evaluate the need or efficacy of their computational artifact(s).

The Faculty repeat: the responsibility to develop, review, and submit IRB proposals to your project reader(s)
is fully incumbent on students. Readers may advise that these proposals are either strongly recommended or
necessary, but students must complete this work.

The College requires, however, that faculty members submit proposals to the IRB. It is the resposibility of
projects readers to review, provide feedback on, and submit these proposals in an equally timely manner. It
is fully within readers' power to deem a proposal unacceptable even if that means missing appropriate deadlines
and rendering any IRB-approved study unfeasible.

#### Comp deliverables

> Note: Students completing `DOUBL` may revise this section significantly.

Students agree to complete (at a minimum) a computational artifact and document which conform to miniumum departmental
requirements. For the CIS department, the _minumum requirements_ for a _passing_ Comp project are listed below. Note that
assignments and activities completed as part of `600`-level course work may add qualitative or quantitative specifics
to each of the items below. The additions will not substantivley change the structure of these deliverables but will
add criteria that describe examples of higher-quality submissions for each of these.

##### Demo day presentation

A presentation of a maximum of `5` minutes given on an assigned day which adequately describes:

- An introduction to the project
- A clear description/depiction of the research need or service gap addressed
- The planned computational artifact and its audience (user, customer, reader)
- Competing attempts or major contributions already achieved by others
- The ways in which your intervention or effort differs
- A conclusion that summarizes 3-4 points the audience should remember about your project

##### Computational artifact

A reader-approved computational object (presentation, executable binary, web service, et al.) which:

- Executes on a system other than the researcher's own or is displayable
- Achieves agreed-upon goals developed in consultation with your reader(s)
- Is stored in a Github repository with evidence of iterative commits over a semester's time
- Contains adequate documentation and licensure to describe and release the project
- Uses appropriate best practices including, but not limited to:
  - linting
  - testing
  - CI/CD release, deployment, evaluation
  - code coverage metrics

##### Thesis writing

- An `Abstract` which provide a concise and compelling summary of the research
- An `Introduction` which:
  - clearly describes and summarizes the project
  - describes the professional or societal needs or forces motivating the work
  - outlines the ethical implications of the thesis
- A `Related Work` section which:
  - references and describes relevant literature
  - explains how relevant literature connects to the project
  - situates the completed project in the broader scope of similar work completed contemporaneously or in the past
- A `Method` section which:
  - explains the processes, approaches, or frameworks used to complete the computational artifact
  - addresses and describes at least one of:
    - algorithms involved or developed
    - implications and choice of programming languages used
    - any external libraries employed
    - platforms used for release, deployment, or other relevant purpose including:
      - hardware
      - server/server-less technologies (AWS, Vercel, et al.)
  - references the GitHub repository that contains the implementation of the project's computational artifact(s)
  - gives examples of the input and output of the project's computational artifact(s)
- An `Experiments` section which:
  - includes a description of reproducible experiments which assess the efficacy of computational artifact(s)
  - contains a description of how the results and artifact(s) are validated
  - contains at least one graph, table or other relevant presentation of the results from the experiment
  - details threats to validity or shortcomings/limitations of the experiment(s)
- A concluding `Future Work` section which:
  - discusses the potential professional or societal impact of the completed research project
  - critically reflects on the success of the completed research project
  - outlines, with sufficient depth and detail, avenues for further and/or future work

##### `DOUBL` Comp project full requirements

While the above requirements are defined by the CIS department in assignments given in the appropriate `600`-level class, 
students completing a `DOUBL` project will need to seek out and amend this contract to adequately represent the additional 
'or unified set of requirements developed in consultation with project readers.

_This will require students to schedule meetings at which all Comp readers are present._ It is impossible to adequately
represent the needs of all departments involved by proxy. As such, it is the student's responsibilty to have specified
and completely described the full project expectations of both departments in this section, by the above-listed contract 
due date. Students not requiring contract modifications to this section of the document may delete the `TODO` below _and_
remove this subsection.

> `TODO`: Outline additional expectations.
